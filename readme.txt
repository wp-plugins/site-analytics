Go Daddy Site Analytics gives you the in-depth data you need to help attract new visitors, increase sales, discover costly errors and more.

== Description ==

By providing a wealth of data on your visitors, Site Analytics can help you determine where to spend your online advertising dollars, which offers are most effective (and which ones aren't working at all), how long are visitors staying and much more. Data is accessible through more than 30 different reports, so pinpointing the information you need is quick and simple.  Installation is also a breeze. Go Daddy Site Analytics automatically installs its tracking script across your entire blog. It also gives you the ability to only track select pages and even allows you to track admin areas in addition to public pages.
 
While there are no shortage of site statistic plugins, Go Daddy Site Analytics goes above and beyond with features designed for people who want valuable, detailed information at a moment's notice. Key features include:

* Real-time statistics let you follow the results of your latest promotion, without having to wait until the end of the day.
* Conversion tracking allows you to track the success of your online marketing efforts.
* Site Summary information centralizes all of your most vital data so you can see results at a glance.
* Data export lets you view, manipulate and catalog your statistics in Microsoft Excel®.
* Visit-path reporting shows you how customers are making their way through your site.
* Custom date ranges let you focus on a specific time period so you can analyze and compare.
